# MyWand
a bukkit Magical Wand Plugin


Magical MyWand is a new Plugin that has easy to use enchants
Uses a Custom Blaze Rod that can be obtained with the command /wand
Right Click to Change the Spell, Left Click to Do the Spell.
The Blaze Rod has to meet some custom stuff to be magical, so the blaze rods
that drops the blazers are not magical, only the ones that obtained by the command /wand

The list of current spells are:

1 Thunder = throw a thunder pigs to pigmans creeper to powered creepers etc...
2 TP 2 TP = Teleport you to the nearest drop, mob or player and teleport them at your position like exchange tp
3 TNT = throws an explosion
4 FLY = makes you Fly like Jumping in the air you have to continue click the mouse to fly more
5 Disarm = Disarm Skeletons Zombies Pigmans and Players, it disappears whatever they have on their hands
6 Move It = it brings to you the item drops and the animals, and it launch throw the air all monsters
7 Capture = it creates a timed Fence that captures all the animals or monsters near you for like 10 seconds

TO-DO:
add permissions
add cooldowns
add config files
maybe remove the command /wand and add the wand to a mob drop percent chance
